examples:
- An example of a CI pipeline could include operations such as environment configuration, building
  the application, running unit tests, and deploying to some online artifact repository.
- An example of a GitHub Actions involving runtime configuration, code checkout, running static checks on the code, 
  running unit tests, and deploying to a staging environment.

- "## Pipeline design\n\nIn essence, designing a CI system is designing a software\
  \ construction, verification, and delivery *pipeline*\nwith the abstractions provided\
  \ by the selected provider.\n\n1. **Think** of all the operations required starting\
  \ from one or more *blank* VMs\n    * OS configuration\n    * Software installation\n\
  \    * Project checkout\n    * Compilation\n    * Testing\n    * Secrets configuration\n\
  \    * Delivery\n    * ...\n2. **Organize** them in a dependency graph\n3. **Model**\
  \ the graph with the provided CI tooling\n\nConfiguration can grow complex, and\
  \ is usually stored in a YAML file\n<br>\n(but there are exceptions, JetBrains TeamCity\
  \ uses a Kotlin DSL).\n"

question: In the context of continuous integration, provide an overview of the abstract
  pipeline design
see_also:
- Consider discussing additional CI/CD such as self-hosted runners, build matrices, etc.
- Mention actual technologies such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI in implementing CI pipelines.
- Discuss common challenges in CI pipeline design such as managing secrets, scaling tests, and caching.
should:
- Describe what is continuous integration (CI) and its role in software development.
- Motivate the naming CI, emphasizing the meaning of "continous"
- Outline the key steps involved in designing an abstract CI pipeline.
- Discuss the operations typically required in a CI pipeline, such as runtime configuration, compilation, testing, release.
- Describe which events can trigger a CI pipeline and why.
- Mention how CI systems help maintain software quality and delivery speed.
- Mention that building in isolated environments to avoid dependency issues and improve compatibility, while allowing developers to continue working.
should_not:
- Overlook the necessity for automation and speed in the CI process.
- Mention irrelevant aspects of CI that do not pertain to pipeline design, like user
  interfaces or unrelated software tools.
- Fail to acknowledge the context of using isolated environments for build processes.
