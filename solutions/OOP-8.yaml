examples:
- A string in Python is immutable; once created, you cannot change its state.
- A tuple cannot have its elements changed after it is created, making it a good example
  of an immutable type.

- "## Immutable vs. Mutable Objects (pt. 1)\n\n- Objects are __immutable__ if their\
  \ _state_ cannot be _changed_ after they are _created_\n    + e.g., `int`, `float`,\
  \ `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`\n\n- Objects are __mutable__ if their _state_ can\
  \ be _changed_ after they are _created_\n    + e.g., `list`, `dict`, `set`\n\n-\
  \ Immutability is a _good_ thing, as it makes objects _easier_ to reason about,\
  \ and _safer_ to use\n    + e.g., you can pass an immutable object to a function\
  \ without worrying that it will be changed by that function\n\n- Yet, immutability\
  \ can be _inconvenient_ in some cases\n    + e.g., data needs to be _updated_ in\
  \ place, rather than _replaced_ by a new object\n"
- "## Immutable vs. Mutable Objects (pt. 2)\n\n> When designing a class, you should\
  \ decide whether it should be _immutable_ or _mutable_ design\n\n### How to achieve\
  \ immutability\n\n1. The attributes of an _immutable_ object should be _read-only_\n\
  \    + i.e., they should be _set_ only in the constructor, and _never_ changed afterwards\n\
  \n2. The attributes of an _immutable_ object should be _immutable_ themselves\n\
  \    + e.g., if an attribute is a `list`, it should be replaced by a `tuple`\n\n\
  3. State-changing methods should apply the __copy-on-write__ pattern\n    + i.e.,\
  \ they should _not_ change the object's state, but return a _new_ object with the\
  \ _updated_ state\n\n### Suggestions\n\n- Make classes _immutable_ by default, and\
  \ _mutable_ only when necessary\n    + this is a _good_ practice, as it makes the\
  \ class _safer_ to use\n\n- Alternatively, support both mutability and immutability\n\
  \    + e.g., implement methods via the __copy-on-write__ pattern, but provide an\
  \ optional parameter to _activate_ in-place updates\n"

question: In the context of OOP, when is a data type considered immutable?
see_also:
- Discuss when immutability is beneficial, such as in concurrent programming or functional
  programming paradigms.
- Mention the trade-offs between mutable and immutable designs, particularly in software
  performance and memory management.
- Explore the concept of 'value objects' in OOP and their association with immutability.
- Relate the decision of immutability versus mutability to software maintainability
  and readability.
should:
- Define immutability in the context of OOP and its significance.
- Provide examples of immutable data types (e.g., `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`).
- Explain how immutable objects differ from mutable objects (e.g., `list`, `dict`).
- Identify the characteristics that make an object immutable (e.g., read-only attributes,
  immutable attribute types).
- Mention the benefits of using immutable objects (e.g., safety, ease of reasoning).
- Discuss the implications of immutability in terms of function arguments and data
  consistency.
- Explain design considerations when deciding to use immutability, such as the use
  of copy-on-write patterns.
should_not:
- Confuse immutability with mutability; clarity is crucial in definitions.
- Provide examples of mutable objects when discussing immutability (e.g., lists should
  not be included when explaining immutability).
- Use vague terms or abstract concepts without specific definitions or relevant examples.
- Overgeneralize the benefits or drawbacks of immutability without providing context
  or examples.
