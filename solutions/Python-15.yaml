  \ whose names start _and end_ with `__`\n        * e.g., `def __init__(self):`\n\
  \        * these are _not_ private, but rather _special_, methods: override them\
  \ only if you know what you are doing\n\n- __Protected__ attributes and methods\

  \ classes\n    + they are _inherited_ and _accessible_ from the _derived_ classes\n\

  - __Protected__ attributes can be used to factorize some functionality in a _base_\
  \ class, and _reuse_ it __only__ in the _derived_ classes\n\n- __Public__ attributes\
  \ and methods are _accessible_ from outside the class\n    + non-private and non-protected\
  \ attributes and methods are _public_ by default\n"

question: In Python, how would you mark a class attribute as private?
see_also:
- Mention Python's 'consenting adults' principle, explaining that private attributes
  can technically be accessed but should not.
- Discuss the impact of private attribute usage on future maintainability of code.
- Introduce the concept of encapsulation and why it is critical in software design.
should:
- Define a private class attribute clearly as one that starts with `__`, e.g., `self.__attribute_name`.
- Explain that private attributes are not accessible from outside the class or derived
  classes.
- Mention the significance of information hiding for data encapsulation and protection.
- Provide examples of both private and protected attributes, contrasting them effectively.
- Use clear terminology to describe private and protected attributes, avoiding ambiguity
  about their accessibility.
should_not:
- Include vague terms like 'private variables' without clear definitions and examples.
- Confuse private attributes with protected or public attributes.
- Fail to mention the convention of using double underscores for truly private members.
- Omit the potential pitfalls of accessing private attributes from outside the class.
