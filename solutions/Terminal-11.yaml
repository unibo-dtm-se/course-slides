  \ the shell is \"in\" a directory, which is called the __current working directory__\
  \ (CWD)\n    - by default, commands _operate_ on the CWD (i.e. they read and write\
  \ files in the CWD)\n    - that directory should be shown _somewhere_ in the shell's\
  \ _prompt_\n    - if not shown, you can always _ask_ the shell to show it, via some\
  \ command\n\n- If one wants to operate on a _file_ in a _different directory_...\n\
  \    + ... they have to _change_ the CWD\n        - this is done via the `cd` command\
  \ (change directory)\n\n    + ... without changing the CWD, they have to _specify_\
  \ the __path__ to the file\n        - this is done via the _absolute_ or _relative_\

question: In a *nix system shell, how would you to create a directory?
see_also:
- Importance of understanding command-line interfaces vs. graphical user interfaces
  in software engineering.
- How directory structures are fundamental in organizing files in operating systems.
- The concept of paths in *nix systems, both absolute and relative, and their usage
  with the `mkdir` command.
should:
- 'Mention the command to create a directory in a *nix system shell: `mkdir <directory_name>`.'
- Explain the purpose of the `mkdir` command in creating directories.
- Indicate how to verify that the directory has been created (e.g., using `ls` to
  list the contents of the parent directory).
- Provide examples of both absolute and relative paths when creating a directory with
  `mkdir`.
- Discuss common options for `mkdir`, such as `-p` for creating parent directories
  as needed.
should_not:
- Use incorrect syntax or command names, such as `mkfolder` instead of `mkdir`.
- Neglect to explain the significance of the command or the directory structure in
  *nix systems.
- Fail to mention that the command must be run in the shell and what context the command
  needs (current working directory).
