- "## Automated tests as sentinels\n\n- Creating _automated_ test procedures makes\
  \ the activity of _testing_ very __cheap__ (in terms of effort)\n    - this allows\
  \ developers to _test_ the software _often_ and _early_\n\n- Being cheap, automated\
  \ tests can serve as [canaries in cold mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species)\n\
  \    - i.e. __sentinels__ for the (early) detection of _problems_\n\n- Test __failures__\
  \ are _precious_ during development\n    - they help in localising the _source_\
  \ of the problem\n\n> The more granular the tests, the easier it is to spot and\
  \ fix problems\n"
- '## Automated vs. manual


  Running an application manually is a form of testing: *exploratory testing*.

  * Done **without a plan**


  <br>


  If there is a plan that can be followed step-by-step, then *there is a program that
  can do it for you*

  * If a program can do it for you, the it *should* do it for you

  \ as well, right?\n\n<br>\n\n* Yes, but:\n  - tests are not only about _verifying_\

  - What issues may arise in the long run when a software project is lacking automated
  testing?

  Developing without testing is *unsustainable*

question: Why one may want to have automated tests in a software project?
see_also:
- Mention the long-term cost implications of not having automated tests, linked to
  technical debt.
- Introduce the concept of test-driven development (TDD) and its relevance to automated
  testing.
- Highlight common misconceptions about time and resources for testing versus the
  benefits it brings.
should:
- Explain that automated tests reduce the cost of testing, allowing for frequent and
  early testing.
- Discuss the value of automated tests as early detection tools (sentinels) for identifying
  issues in the software.
- Mention that test failures provide critical information for debugging and isolating
  problems.
- Highlight the importance of having tests at all levels of granularity (unit, integration,
  end-to-end).
- Illustrate how automated testing contrasts with manual testing and why automation
  is preferable when a plan exists.
should_not:
- Avoid stating that automated tests are optional or not essential for all projects.
- Do not suggest that manual testing is always sufficient or better than automated
  testing.
- Refrain from oversimplifying the discussion by stating that just one type of testing
  (unit, integration, etc.) is enough.
